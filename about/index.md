## About

My name is Abraham Mhaidli (as you could have guessed). PhD student at university of Michigan's School of Information, studying the intersection of privacy, technology, and ethics. 
Interests include soccer, cooking, the fine art of popcorn making, rapping, and being an all around lazy bum. Also videogames. And reading. And dark humor.
