<center><b>JBlog</b> is a simple jekyll theme.</center>

## About

My name is Abraham Mhaidli (as you could have guessed). PhD student at university of Michigan's School of Information, studying the intersection of privacy, technology, and ethics. 
Interests include soccer, cooking, the fine art of popcorn making, rapping, and being an all around lazy bum. Also videogames. And reading. And dark humor.

And I also have a ginormous ego, hence there are approximately 6000 images that follow of me and my unique combination of adorable and ruggedly handsome for you to bask in.

I mean look at that body!

A picture showing my two loves, technology and cooking, in action:

Well I do not have 6000 images, but congrats on making it down here! As a reward, here is a brief cooking tip: when making stovetop rice, do not stir the rice halfway through. Ruins the cooking process.
Also do not serve chicken with red wine. Nor steak with white wine.
